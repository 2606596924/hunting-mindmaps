# Threat hunting mindmaps

This repository contains a few personal mindmaps I use as a reference for threat hunting and incident response. It is currently highly WIP. 

- [Windows Event Logs](./pdf/windows-basic-event-logs.pdf)

## Work in progress

- Hunting for common lateral movement mechanisms
- Volatility modules
- Evidence of execution (prefetch files, Amcache...)
- Methods of credentials theft and associated protections

## Disclaimer

These mindmaps are for my personal reference and might consequently be incomplete, intentionally or not. Feel free to open an issue for discussion though!
